description:
  short: Cross-chain bridging and interoperability
  what_it_does: |
    Implements cross-chain communication and asset bridging between
    different blockchains. Covers bridges (Wormhole, LayerZero, Axelar),
    wrapped assets, and cross-chain messaging protocols.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot guarantee bridge security. Cannot reverse bridge hacks.
    Cannot make instant cross-chain finality. Cannot bridge unsupported
    assets.

capabilities:

    - bridge_integration:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Integrate Wormhole, LayerZero, Axelar
    - wrapped_assets:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Handle wrapped asset mechanics
    - cross_chain_messaging:
        confidence: 0.85
        description: Implement cross-chain message passing
    - bridge_aggregation:
        confidence: 0.88
        description: Use Li.Fi, Socket for optimal routes
    - multi_chain_state:
        confidence: 0.82
        description: Sync state across chains
  cannot:
    - guarantee_security:
        reason: Bridge security depends on third parties
    - instant_finality:
        reason: Cross-chain inherently has latency
    - reverse_hacks:
        reason: Bridge exploits are often irreversible
    - arbitrary_bridging:
        reason: Limited to supported assets/chains

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: bridge_selection
      severity: critical
      trigger: "bridge|cross-chain|transfer"
      check: "Use established bridges (Wormhole, LayerZero) for security"
    - name: finality_awareness
      severity: high
      trigger: "instant|immediate|fast"
      check: "Cross-chain has inherent latency, never instant"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Using unaudited bridges
      correction: Stick to established, audited bridge protocols
    - mistake: Ignoring chain finality differences
      correction: Wait for sufficient confirmations on each chain

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Solana"
      approach: "Wormhole with proper confirmation waits"
    - task: "Implement cross-chain NFT"
      approach: "LayerZero OFT standard for omnichain tokens"
  bad:
    - task: "Trust new bridge with large amounts"
      reason: "Bridge exploits are common, use established protocols"

synergies:
