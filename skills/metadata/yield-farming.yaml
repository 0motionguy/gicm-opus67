  short: DeFi yield optimization strategies
  what_it_does: |
    Optimizes yield farming strategies across DeFi protocols. Covers
    yield aggregators (Yearn, Beefy), farming mechanics, compounding
    strategies, and risk-adjusted returns.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot guarantee yields. Cannot predict protocol failures. Cannot
    eliminate smart contract risks. Cannot provide sustainable yields
    from unsustainable tokenomics.

capabilities:
  can:
    - yield_optimization:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Find and compare yield opportunities
    - compound_strategies:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Implement auto-compounding strategies
    - yield_aggregator_integration:
        confidence: 0.88
        description: Integrate Yearn, Beefy, Tulip
    - risk_assessment:
        confidence: 0.85
        description: Evaluate protocol and smart contract risks
    - apr_calculation:
        confidence: 0.94
        description: Calculate APR/APY accurately
  cannot:
    - guarantee_yields:
        reason: Yields vary with market conditions
    - predict_failures:
        reason: Protocol exploits are unpredictable
    - eliminate_risk:
        reason: DeFi has inherent risks
    - sustainable_ponzinomics:
        reason: Unsustainable yields eventually collapse

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: yield_sustainability
      severity: critical
      trigger: "high yield|APY|APR"
      check: "Question where yield comes from - is it sustainable?"
    - name: smart_contract_risk
      severity: high
      trigger: "farm|stake|deposit"
      check: "Check if contracts are audited"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Chasing highest APY blindly
      correction: Evaluate risk-adjusted returns
    - mistake: Not accounting for gas/fees
      correction: Include all costs in yield calculations

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Optimize stablecoin yields"
      approach: "Compare lending rates, pick audited protocols, auto-compound"
    - task: "Set up auto-compounding farm"
      approach: "Use Beefy vault or implement custom compounder"
  bad:
    - task: "Farm 1000% APY on new protocol"
      reason: "Unsustainable, likely high risk or scam"
