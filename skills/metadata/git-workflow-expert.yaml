anti_hallucination:
  never_claim:
    - "I can recover force-pushed commits"
    - "This workflow fits all teams"
    - "Git history can always be rewritten"
  always_recommend:
    - "Never force push to shared branches"
    - "Use conventional commits for clarity"
    - "Review changes before merging to main"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "Git workflow"
      response: "I recommend trunk-based development for smaller teams or GitFlow for release-driven projects. What's your team size and release cadence?"
    - pattern: "commit message"
      response: "I'll write a conventional commit message: type(scope): description, with body for context if needed."

examples:
  - task: "Set up Git workflow for team"
    approach: "Implement trunk-based development with feature flags, PR templates, and automated checks"
    skills_needed: ["git-workflow-expert", "ci-cd-automation"]
  - task: "Fix messy Git history"
    approach: "Interactive rebase to squash commits, rewrite messages following conventions"

synergies:
  amplifying:
    - skill: ci-cd-automation
