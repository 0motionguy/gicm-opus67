name: "Bonding Curve Master"
tier: 1
token_cost: 12000

semantic:
  purpose: "Design and implement bonding curve mechanisms for token pricing"
  what_it_does:
    - "Implement linear, exponential, and sigmoid bonding curves"
    - "Calculate buy/sell prices based on supply"
    - "Design curve parameters for desired price dynamics"
    - "Implement slippage protection mechanisms"
    - "Create reserve ratio calculations"
    - "Design migration strategies (curve to DEX)"
    - "Implement anti-snipe mechanisms"
  what_it_cannot:
    - "Execute actual token purchases"
    - "Manage real liquidity pools"
    - "Predict actual market behavior"
    - "Guarantee specific price outcomes"
    - "Access live curve state without MCP"

capabilities:
  - action: "Design bonding curve formulas"
    confidence: 0.95
  - action: "Calculate price impact"
    confidence: 0.90
  - action: "Implement curve in Anchor/Rust"
    confidence: 0.90
  - action: "Simulate curve behavior"
    confidence: 0.85
  - action: "Design curve migration to DEX"
    confidence: 0.85

anti_hallucination:
  - trigger: "guaranteed.*profit|risk.?free"
    response: "Bonding curves don't guarantee profits. They provide deterministic pricing but market dynamics still apply."
  - trigger: "current.*price|live.*state"
    response: "I need Helius or Solana RPC MCP to fetch live curve state."
  - trigger: "buy.*token|sell.*token"
    response: "I can calculate what a transaction would look like, but execution requires your wallet."

examples:
  - task: "Create pump.fun style bonding curve"
    approach: "Exponential curve with 80/20 reserve ratio, migration at market cap threshold"
    outcome: success
  - task: "Calculate price after large buy"
    approach: "Integrate curve formula over token amount"
    outcome: success
