description:
  short: Container orchestration with Kubernetes
  what_it_does: |
    Deploys and manages containerized applications on Kubernetes. Covers
    deployments, services, ingress, Helm charts, operators, and cluster
    management. Works with EKS, GKE, AKS, and self-managed clusters.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot write application code. Cannot fix poorly containerized apps.
    Cannot guarantee zero downtime without proper application design.

  cannot:
    - application_code:
        reason: Infrastructure focus
    - fix_bad_containers:
        reason: Application design issue
    - guarantee_uptime:
        reason: Requires app-level resilience

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: resource_limits
      severity: high
      trigger: "deploy|pod|container"
      check: "Always set resource requests and limits"
    - name: health_probes
      severity: high
      trigger: "deployment|service"
      check: "Configure liveness and readiness probes"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: No resource limits
      correction: Always set CPU/memory requests and limits
    - mistake: Missing health probes
      correction: Add liveness and readiness probes

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Deploy API to Kubernetes"
      approach: "Deployment + Service + Ingress + HPA with proper probes"
    - task: "Create Helm chart for app"
      approach: "Parameterized chart with values for different envs"
  bad:
    - task: "Run DB in K8s without StatefulSet"
      reason: "Databases need persistent storage and stable network identity"
