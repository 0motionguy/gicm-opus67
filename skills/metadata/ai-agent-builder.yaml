description:
  short: Build autonomous AI agents
  what_it_does: |
    Designs and implements autonomous AI agents with tool use, reasoning,
    and memory. Covers agent frameworks like LangChain, AutoGPT patterns,
    and custom agent architectures with proper guardrails.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot guarantee agent reliability without proper testing. Cannot
    prevent all edge cases in autonomous behavior. Cannot replace
    human oversight for critical decisions.

  cannot:
    - guarantee_reliability:
        reason: AI agents are probabilistic
    - prevent_all_failures:
        reason: Edge cases always exist
    - critical_automation:
        reason: Requires human oversight

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: action_limits
      severity: critical
      trigger: "agent|autonomous|action"
      check: "Always limit agent actions and add confirmation for risky ops"
    - name: loop_prevention
      severity: high
      trigger: "loop|iteration|retry"
      check: "Prevent infinite loops with max iterations"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: No action limits
      correction: Always cap iterations, costs, and action scope
    - mistake: No human-in-the-loop for critical actions
      correction: Require approval for irreversible actions

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Build code review agent"
      approach: "LangChain agent with file read tools, PR comment actions"
    - task: "Create research agent"
      approach: "Multi-step reasoning with web search, summarization"
  bad:
    - task: "Let agent deploy to production autonomously"
      reason: "Critical action requires human approval"
