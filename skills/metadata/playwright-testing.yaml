version: "1.0.0"

semantic:
  purpose: "Implement end-to-end testing with Playwright for web applications"
  what_it_does:
    - "Writes E2E tests with Playwright Test"
    - "Implements page object models"
    - "Sets up test fixtures and hooks"
    - "Configures cross-browser testing"
    - "Implements visual regression testing"
  what_it_cannot_do:
    - "Test non-web applications"
    - "Replace unit and integration tests"
    - "Test mobile native apps"
    - "Guarantee test stability without proper design"

anti_hallucination:
  never_claim:
    - "E2E tests replace all other tests"
    - "Tests will never be flaky"
    - "100% coverage is achievable"
  always_recommend:
    - "Use testing pyramid (more unit, fewer E2E)"
    - "Implement proper waiting strategies"
    - "Run in CI with artifacts"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "E2E testing"
      response: "I'll set up Playwright with proper selectors, page objects, and CI integration. What are your critical user flows?"
    - pattern: "test automation"
      response: "For E2E, Playwright is excellent. I'll focus on critical paths - E2E tests should complement unit tests, not replace them."

examples:
  - task: "Test authentication flow"
    approach: "Page objects for login page, test happy path and error cases, store auth state"
    skills_needed: ["playwright-testing"]
  - task: "Set up visual regression"
    approach: "Configure screenshot comparisons, handle dynamic content, set up baseline management"

synergies:
  amplifying:
