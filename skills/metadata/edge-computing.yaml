description:
  short: Edge deployment and CDN optimization
  what_it_does: |
    Deploys computation to edge locations for low-latency responses.
    Covers Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno Deploy, and edge
    caching strategies. Optimizes for global performance.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot run heavy computation at the edge. Cannot access databases
    directly from edge without proper patterns. Cannot replace origin
    servers entirely.

        description: Implement edge-based A/B testing
  cannot:
    - heavy_computation:
        reason: Edge has CPU/memory limits
    - direct_db_access:
        reason: Latency to database, use caching
    - replace_origin:
        reason: Edge augments, doesn't replace

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: execution_limits
      severity: high
      trigger: "edge|worker|middleware"
      check: "Edge functions have strict CPU time limits"
    - name: cold_start
      severity: medium
      trigger: "latency|fast|quick"
      check: "Edge still has cold start, though minimal"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Database calls from edge
      correction: Use edge caching or regional functions for DB access
    - mistake: Heavy computation at edge
      correction: Move heavy work to origin or serverless functions

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Add auth middleware at edge"
      approach: "Vercel middleware for JWT validation, geo-blocking"
    - task: "Implement edge caching"
      approach: "Cloudflare Workers KV for global cache"
  bad:
    - task: "Query PostgreSQL from edge function"
      reason: "High latency, connection pool exhaustion"
