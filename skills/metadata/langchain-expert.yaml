version: "1.0.0"

semantic:
  purpose: "Build LLM applications using LangChain framework"
  what_it_does:
    - "Implements chains and agents"
    - "Sets up document loaders and text splitters"
    - "Implements vector stores and retrievers"
    - "Creates custom tools and agents"
    - "Implements memory patterns"
  what_it_cannot_do:
    - "Replace proper prompt engineering"
    - "Train underlying LLM models"
    - "Guarantee agent reliability"
    - "Handle all edge cases automatically"

  always_recommend:
    - "Test agents thoroughly"
    - "Implement fallback logic"
    - "Monitor token usage"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "LangChain"
      response: "I'll implement using LangChain with proper error handling. Using LangChain.js or Python?"

examples:
  - task: "Build document Q&A system"
    approach: "Document loaders, text splitting, vector store, retrieval QA chain"

synergies:
  amplifying:
    - skill: vector-db-expert
      reason: "RAG requires vector storage"
    - skill: openai-integration
      reason: "Common LLM provider for LangChain"
