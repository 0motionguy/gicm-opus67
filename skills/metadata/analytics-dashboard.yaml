  cannot:
    - define_kpis:
        reason: Requires business stakeholder input
    - fix_data_quality:
        reason: Upstream data issue
    - complex_bi_analysis:
        reason: Use specialized BI tools

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: kpi_definition
      severity: medium
      trigger: "kpi|metric|measure"
      check: "KPIs must be defined by business stakeholders"
    - name: performance
      severity: high
      trigger: "slow|loading|performance"
      check: "Pre-aggregate metrics, don't calculate on the fly"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Calculating metrics on every page load
      correction: Pre-compute and cache aggregations
    - mistake: Too many KPIs on one dashboard
      correction: Focus on 5-7 key metrics per dashboard

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Build trading performance dashboard"
      approach: "Next.js + Recharts with real-time WebSocket updates"
    - task: "Create Grafana dashboard for system metrics"
      approach: "Prometheus data source with alerting"
  bad:
    - task: "Show 100 metrics on homepage"
      reason: "Information overload, prioritize key metrics"
