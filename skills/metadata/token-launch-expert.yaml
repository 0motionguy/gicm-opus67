  cannot:
    - guarantee_success:
        reason: Market determines value
    - prevent_all_bots:
        reason: Sophisticated bots adapt
    - legal_advice:
        reason: Requires legal expertise
    - control_post_launch:
        reason: Decentralized after launch

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: liquidity_lock
      severity: critical
      trigger: "launch|liquidity|pool"
      check: "Always lock or burn initial liquidity"
    - name: vesting_for_team
      severity: high
      trigger: "team|allocation|distribution"
      check: "Team tokens must have vesting"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: No liquidity lock
      correction: Lock LP tokens for minimum 6-12 months
    - mistake: Large team allocation without vesting
      correction: Vest team tokens over 2-4 years

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Launch token on Raydium"
      approach: "Create pool, add liquidity, lock LP, gradual release"
    - task: "Fair launch with no presale"
      approach: "All tokens in LP, locked, no team allocation"
  bad:
    - task: "Launch with 50% team tokens unlocked"
      reason: "Rug pull risk, destroys trust"
