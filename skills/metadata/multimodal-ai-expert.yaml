description:
  short: Vision, audio, and multimodal AI
  what_it_does: |
    Implements multimodal AI solutions combining text, images, audio,
    and video. Covers vision-language models, image generation (DALL-E,
    Midjourney), speech-to-text, and multimodal embeddings.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot generate real-time video. Cannot process extremely large
    images/videos efficiently. Cannot guarantee content appropriateness
    without moderation.

capabilities:
  can:
    - vision_language:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Use GPT-4V, Claude vision, etc.
    - image_generation:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Generate images with DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
    - image_analysis:
        confidence: 0.93
        description: Analyze and describe images
    - speech_to_text:
        confidence: 0.94
        description: Transcribe audio with Whisper
    - multimodal_embeddings:
        confidence: 0.85
        description: Create CLIP-style multimodal embeddings
  cannot:
    - real_time_video:
        reason: Latency constraints
    - large_media_processing:
        reason: API limits
    - content_moderation:
        reason: Requires specialized models

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: image_accuracy
      severity: medium
      trigger: "analyze|describe|ocr"
      check: "Vision models can misread text, always verify"
    - name: generation_limits
      severity: medium
      trigger: "generate|create|image"
      check: "Image generation has content policy limits"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Trusting OCR without verification
      correction: Always verify extracted text for critical data
    - mistake: No image size optimization
      correction: Resize images before API calls

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Analyze NFT artwork for traits"
      approach: "GPT-4V for description, CLIP for similarity"
    - task: "Generate marketing images"
      approach: "DALL-E with detailed prompts, human review"
  bad:
    - task: "OCR private keys from screenshots"
      reason: "Security risk, never trust automated extraction"

  conflicts: []
