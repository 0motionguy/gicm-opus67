  short: Decentralized governance implementation
  what_it_does: |
    Implements DAO governance systems including voting mechanisms, proposal
    lifecycles, treasury management, and on-chain governance. Works with
    Realms (Solana), Governor (EVM), and custom governance solutions.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot prevent governance attacks. Cannot ensure voter participation.
    Cannot fix fundamental tokenomics issues through governance.

capabilities:
  can:
    - governance_contracts:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Implement OpenZeppelin Governor, Realms
    - voting_mechanisms:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Token voting, quadratic voting, conviction voting
    - proposal_lifecycle:
        confidence: 0.94
        description: Design proposal creation, voting, execution
    - treasury_governance:
        confidence: 0.88
        description: DAO treasury management with multisig
    - delegation:
        confidence: 0.86
        description: Implement vote delegation systems
  cannot:
    - prevent_governance_attacks:
        reason: Depends on token distribution
    - ensure_participation:
        reason: Community engagement issue
    - fix_tokenomics:
        reason: Fundamental design issue

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: timelock_required
      severity: critical
      trigger: "governance|proposal|execute"
      check: "Always use timelock for governance execution"
    - name: quorum_setting
      severity: high
      trigger: "vote|quorum|threshold"
      check: "Set appropriate quorum to prevent attacks"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: No timelock on governance
      correction: Add timelock for users to exit before execution
    - mistake: Low quorum requirements
      correction: Set quorum based on realistic participation

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Build DAO governance for protocol"
      approach: "Governor + Timelock + token voting with delegation"
    - task: "Implement Solana DAO"
      approach: "Realms with SPL governance program"
  bad:
    - task: "Execute proposals immediately"
      reason: "No time for community to react to malicious proposals"
