description:
  short: MEV protection and transaction ordering
  what_it_does: |
    Protects transactions from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks
    including front-running, sandwich attacks, and back-running. Implements
    private mempools, commit-reveal schemes, and MEV-aware transaction routing.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot guarantee complete MEV protection in all cases. Cannot protect
    against all forms of information leakage. Cannot prevent MEV from
    on-chain data once revealed.

        description: Use Jito bundles on Solana
  cannot:
    - complete_protection:
        reason: Some MEV is unavoidable
    - prevent_on_chain_mev:
        reason: Once on-chain, data is public
    - hide_all_intent:
        reason: Some information always leaks

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: slippage_settings
      severity: critical
      trigger: "swap|trade|dex"
      check: "Always set tight slippage tolerance (0.5-1%) and deadline"
    - name: private_submission
      severity: high
      trigger: "large|whale|significant"
      check: "Use private mempool for large transactions"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: High slippage tolerance (5%+)
      correction: Use 0.5-1% slippage, split large trades
    - mistake: Public mempool for large swaps
      correction: Use Flashbots, Jito, or private RPC

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Execute large swap safely"
      approach: "Flashbots Protect, tight slippage, split into chunks"
    - task: "Protect DeFi interaction from front-running"
      approach: "Private mempool + commit-reveal for sensitive operations"
  bad:
    - task: "Swap $100k with 10% slippage"
      reason: "Will be sandwiched immediately"
