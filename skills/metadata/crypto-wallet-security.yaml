  short: Cryptocurrency wallet security and key management
  what_it_does: |

        confidence: 0.95
        description: Implement secure key generation and storage
    - wallet_integration:
        confidence: 0.93
        description: Integrate wallets securely (Phantom, MetaMask, etc.)
    - transaction_security:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Secure transaction signing and validation
    - multisig_setup:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Configure multisignature wallets
    - seed_phrase_handling:
        confidence: 0.95
        description: Secure mnemonic/seed phrase management
  cannot:
    - key_recovery:
        reason: Cryptographically impossible without backup
    - hardware_audit:
        reason: Requires physical device analysis
    - firmware_verification:
        reason: Hardware wallet specific
    - phishing_prevention:
        reason: Requires user education

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: never_log_keys
      severity: critical
      trigger: "private key|seed|mnemonic|secret"
      check: "NEVER log, print, or expose private keys"
    - name: secure_storage
      severity: critical
      trigger: "store|save|persist"
      check: "Use secure enclaves or encrypted storage only"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Storing private keys in plain text
      correction: Always encrypt keys at rest
    - mistake: Logging transaction data with keys
      correction: Sanitize all logs

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Implement secure wallet connection"
      approach: "Use @solana/wallet-adapter with proper signature validation"
    - task: "Set up multisig treasury"
      approach: "Squads Protocol with time-locked transactions"
  bad:
    - task: "Store private key in localStorage"
      reason: "Accessible to any script on the page"
    - task: "Log wallet private key for debugging"
      reason: "Critical security violation"
