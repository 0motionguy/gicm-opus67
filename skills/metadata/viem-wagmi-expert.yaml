  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "Web3 app"
      response: "I'll use Wagmi for wallet connections and Viem for contract interactions. Which chains do you need to support?"
    - pattern: "connect wallet"
      response: "I'll implement Wagmi with your preferred connectors (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase). Using RainbowKit for UI?"

examples:
  - task: "Build NFT minting dApp"
