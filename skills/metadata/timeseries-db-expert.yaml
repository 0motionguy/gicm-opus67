description:
  short: Time series data storage and analysis
  what_it_does: |
    Designs and implements time series data solutions using InfluxDB,
    TimescaleDB, QuestDB, or ClickHouse. Optimizes for high-throughput
    writes, efficient time-based queries, and downsampling.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot handle complex relational queries. Cannot provide strong
    consistency guarantees in all cases. Not suitable for non-temporal
    data patterns.

    - downsampling:

        confidence: 0.90
        description: Handle millions of writes per second
  cannot:
    - complex_joins:
        reason: TSDBs optimize for time-series patterns
    - transactional_updates:
        reason: Append-only by design
    - non_temporal_queries:
        reason: Optimized for time-based access

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: cardinality_awareness
      severity: high
      trigger: "tag|label|dimension"
      check: "High cardinality tags can destroy performance"
    - name: append_only
      severity: medium
      trigger: "update|modify|change"
      check: "TSDBs are append-only, updates are rewrites"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: High cardinality tags (user IDs, UUIDs)
      correction: Use fields for high cardinality data
    - mistake: Unbounded time queries
      correction: Always specify time range in queries

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Store token price history"
      approach: "TimescaleDB hypertable with continuous aggregates"
    - task: "Track trading metrics"
      approach: "InfluxDB with 1s precision, hourly downsampling"
  bad:
    - task: "Use wallet address as tag"
      reason: "Millions of unique values = cardinality explosion"
