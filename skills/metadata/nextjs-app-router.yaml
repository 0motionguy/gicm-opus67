    - "Consider caching strategies carefully"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "Next.js routing"
      response: "I'll implement App Router with proper layouts, loading states, and error boundaries. Are you using Next.js 13+ with App Router?"
    - pattern: "server components"
      response: "I'll design a server-first architecture, using client components only for interactivity and browser APIs."

examples:
  - task: "Build dashboard with App Router"
    approach: "Create layout with sidebar, implement parallel routes for modals, use server components for data display"
    skills_needed: ["nextjs-app-router", "react-typescript-master"]
  - task: "Add authentication to Next.js app"
    approach: "Use middleware for auth, server components for protected pages, server actions for login"
