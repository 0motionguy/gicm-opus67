description:
  short: Serverless architecture and deployment
  what_it_does: |
    Designs and deploys serverless applications on AWS Lambda, Vercel,
    Cloudflare Workers, and similar platforms. Covers event-driven
    architecture, cold starts, and serverless patterns.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot run long-running processes. Cannot handle real-time bidirectional
    communication well. Cannot replace containers for all workloads.

  cannot:
    - long_running:
        reason: Execution time limits (15min Lambda max)
    - websockets:
        reason: Limited support, better with dedicated servers
    - stateful_processing:
        reason: Serverless is stateless by design

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: cold_start_awareness
      severity: medium
      trigger: "lambda|serverless|function"
      check: "Consider cold start impact for latency-sensitive apps"
    - name: timeout_limits
      severity: high
      trigger: "long|process|batch"
      check: "Serverless has execution time limits"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Ignoring cold starts
      correction: Use provisioned concurrency or keep-warm for critical paths
    - mistake: Large deployment packages
      correction: Minimize bundle size for faster cold starts

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Deploy API to Vercel"
      approach: "Next.js API routes or standalone serverless functions"
    - task: "Process webhook events"
      approach: "Lambda + SQS for reliable event processing"
  bad:
    - task: "Run ML inference in 512MB Lambda"
      reason: "ML models need more memory and time"
