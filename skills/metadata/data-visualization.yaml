  cannot:
    - data_analysis:
        reason: Requires statistical expertise
    - business_insights:
        reason: Requires domain knowledge
    - fix_bad_data:
        reason: Garbage in, garbage out

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: chart_type_selection
      severity: medium
      trigger: "chart|graph|visualization"
      check: "Choose chart type based on data relationship, not aesthetics"
    - name: data_density
      severity: medium
      trigger: "too many|all data|every point"
      check: "Aggregate or sample for large datasets"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Pie charts for more than 5 categories
      correction: Use bar charts for many categories
    - mistake: 3D charts for 2D data
      correction: Avoid 3D unless data is truly 3-dimensional

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Build trading dashboard with price charts"
      approach: "TradingView lightweight-charts or Recharts"
    - task: "Visualize token distribution"
      approach: "Treemap or horizontal bar chart"
  bad:
    - task: "Show 1M data points in line chart"
      reason: "Browser will crash, aggregate first"
