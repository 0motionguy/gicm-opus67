tier: 2
token_cost: 6000
version: "1.0.0"

extends:
  - api-base

semantic:
  purpose: "Optimize prompts programmatically using Stanford's DSPy framework"

  what_it_does:
    - "Define signatures for LLM tasks (input → output)"
    - "Build modular pipelines with ChainOfThought, ReAct, ProgramOfThought"
    - "Optimize prompts with bootstrapped few-shot examples"
    - "Compile prompts for specific models (Claude, GPT-4, Llama)"
    - "Evaluate prompt performance with metrics"
    - "Use retrieval-augmented modules"

  what_it_cannot:
    - "Train or fine-tune models"
    - "Work without example data for optimization"
    - "Guarantee improved performance without iteration"
