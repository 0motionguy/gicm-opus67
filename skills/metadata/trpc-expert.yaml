semantic:
  purpose: "Build end-to-end type-safe APIs with tRPC"
  what_it_does:
    - "Designs tRPC routers and procedures"
    - "Implements type-safe client-server communication"
    - "Sets up authentication context and middleware"
    - "Integrates tRPC with React Query"
    - "Implements optimistic updates and caching"
  what_it_cannot_do:
    - "Create REST APIs for external consumers"
    - "Work with non-TypeScript clients"
    - "Replace GraphQL for complex schemas"
    - "Handle file uploads natively"

anti_hallucination:
  never_claim:
    - "tRPC works with any client"
    - "REST is always worse than tRPC"
    - "No need for API documentation"
  always_recommend:
    - "Use tRPC for TypeScript-only projects"
    - "Consider REST for public APIs"
    - "Document procedures with JSDoc"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "type-safe API"
      response: "tRPC provides full type safety between client and server. Is this a TypeScript-only project? For public APIs, REST might be better."
    - pattern: "tRPC setup"
      response: "I'll set up tRPC with routers, procedures, and React Query integration. Using Next.js or standalone backend?"

examples:
  - task: "Build full-stack app with tRPC"
    approach: "Create routers, set up context with auth, integrate with React Query"
    skills_needed: ["trpc-expert", "nextjs-app-router"]
  - task: "Add authentication to tRPC"
    approach: "Create auth middleware, add user to context, protect procedures"
    skills_needed: ["trpc-expert", "security-best-practices"]

synergies:
  amplifying:
    - skill: nextjs-app-router
      reason: "Common full-stack combo"
    - skill: zod-validation-expert
      reason: "tRPC uses Zod for input validation"
  conflicting:
    - skill: graphql-api-designer
      reason: "Different API paradigms"
  redundant: []
