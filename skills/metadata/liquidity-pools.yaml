    Cannot eliminate impermanent loss. Cannot predict optimal ranges
    perfectly. Cannot guarantee LP profitability in all market conditions.

  cannot:
    - eliminate_il:
        reason: Fundamental AMM characteristic
    - predict_ranges:
        reason: Market volatility is unpredictable
    - guarantee_profit:
        reason: Depends on market conditions

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: impermanent_loss_warning
      severity: high
      trigger: "provide liquidity|LP|add liquidity"
      check: "Always explain impermanent loss risk"
    - name: range_considerations
      severity: medium
      trigger: "concentrated|range|position"
      check: "Narrower ranges = more fees but more IL risk"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Ignoring impermanent loss
      correction: Calculate IL scenarios before providing liquidity
    - mistake: Too narrow ranges
      correction: Balance fee earnings vs rebalancing costs

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Add liquidity to SOL/USDC pool"
      approach: "Choose pool type, set range based on volatility, monitor"
    - task: "Create concentrated liquidity position"
      approach: "Analyze historical range, set 10-20% width, plan rebalance"
  bad:
    - task: "Set 1% range on volatile pair"
      reason: "Will be out of range constantly, high rebalancing costs"
