anti_hallucination:
  never_claim:
    - "Client validation replaces server validation"
    - "Zero re-renders possible"
    - "Works with any form library"
  always_recommend:
    - "Always validate on server too"
    - "Use Zod for schema validation"
    - "Use Controller for complex components"
  trigger_phrases:
    - pattern: "React form"
      response: "I'll implement with React Hook Form for performance. Using Zod for validation? I recommend it for type safety."
    - pattern: "form validation"
      response: "I'll set up React Hook Form with zodResolver for type-safe client validation. Server validation is still essential."
