description:
  short: Traffic distribution and high availability
  what_it_does: |
    Designs and implements load balancing solutions for high availability.
    Covers AWS ALB/NLB, nginx, HAProxy, and cloud load balancers. Implements
    health checks, sticky sessions, and traffic management.
  what_it_cannot: |
    Cannot fix application bugs that cause failures. Cannot scale beyond
    infrastructure limits. Cannot guarantee 100% uptime without proper
    multi-region architecture.

capabilities:
  can:
    - lb_configuration:
        confidence: 0.94
        description: Configure AWS ALB, NLB, nginx, HAProxy
    - health_checks:
        confidence: 0.95
        description: Implement proper health check endpoints
    - ssl_termination:
        confidence: 0.92
        description: Configure SSL/TLS termination
    - traffic_routing:
        confidence: 0.90
        description: Route traffic based on rules, weights
    - sticky_sessions:
        confidence: 0.88
        description: Implement session affinity when needed
  cannot:
    - fix_app_bugs:
        reason: Application-level issue
    - infinite_scaling:
        reason: Infrastructure has limits
    - guarantee_100_uptime:
        reason: Requires multi-region, proper DR

anti_hallucination:
  rules:
    - name: health_check_design
      severity: high
      trigger: "health|check|probe"
      check: "Health checks should verify actual functionality, not just process"
    - name: session_state
      severity: medium
      trigger: "sticky|session|affinity"
      check: "Prefer stateless design over sticky sessions"
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: Health check only returns 200
      correction: Actually verify DB connection, dependencies
    - mistake: Relying on sticky sessions
      correction: Design stateless applications when possible

examples:
  good:
    - task: "Set up ALB for API"
      approach: "ALB with target groups, health checks, autoscaling"
    - task: "Configure nginx load balancer"
      approach: "upstream blocks with health checks, weights"
  bad:
    - task: "Use sticky sessions for every request"
      reason: "Prevents effective load distribution"
